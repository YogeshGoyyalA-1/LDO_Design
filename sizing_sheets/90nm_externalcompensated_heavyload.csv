Step 5: Diffamp Input Pair Sizing (Heavy load error will be higher than light load because we used light load Charts),,,,,,,,
,Hand Calculation.,,,,,,,
gm/Iddiff,1.00E+01,,1.58E+00,,,,We want to make sure that the Bias fet has enough headroom,
Id,0.000025,A,,,,,Taking all budget available and check later,
gmro,54.34782609,,7.30E+01,,,,Vds for heavy load lower,
Length,0.09,um,,,,,Get the length for the desired gain from the techplots (gmro vs. gm/Id),
