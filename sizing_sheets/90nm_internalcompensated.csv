Step 1: List Down the Specifications and classify them,,,,
,,,,
,,Value,,Notes
,,,,
Vin,,1.4,,
Vout,,1,,
PSRR,,60,,20*log(Vin/Vout) You can also have it as 20*log(Vout/Vin) and then report PSRR as negative
Iload|min,,2,,
Iload|max,,10,,
Cload,,2,,
Iquiescent,,50,,
Transient duration,,1,,

Low Freq Loop Gain (Alg),,1000,,
Drop Out Voltage,,0.4,,Vin-Vout of the LDO
?I (Load step),,0.008,,Imax-Imin
