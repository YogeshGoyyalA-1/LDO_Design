# Analog CMOS Final Project: LDO Design in High Performance 45nm Technology Node

This repository contains the deliverables and documentation for the Analog CMOS Final Project, where we design an LDO (Low Dropout Regulator) using the HP 45nm technology node. The project employs the gm/id methodology to generate technology-specific plots and design the LDO circuit.

## Project Overview

In this project we have designed an LDO subject to different conditions. For this design we are designing the LDO for both externally and internally compensated LDO. We have considered different technology nodes and for different legths for the same.Our aim is to design the LDO for a max and a min load condition and see where the outputs are more desireable.
